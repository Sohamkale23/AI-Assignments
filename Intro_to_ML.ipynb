        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects follow a structured process to ensure successful implementation. A systematic approach helps in solving real-world problems effectively while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. AI Engineers and Researchers play a pivotal role in different stages of an AI project, from understanding business problems to deploying models. One widely adopted framework for AI projects is the OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret) process. In this article, we will describe each stage and the role of an AI Engineer/Researcher using a customer churn prediction use case in the telecommunications industry.\n",
